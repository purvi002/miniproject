This program shows the calendar, allows to add notes to dates of any month, shows the day of any date of any year, and displays days of any month of any year. 

My code does has a menu that gives the user 4 options: 
	-View the day for any given date 
	-View all the days of the month and then go to the next month or the previous month. This function can also show the notes for all the dates of that particular month.
	-Adding note to any date. This information is saved in a note.dat and can be accessed. 
	-Quit
